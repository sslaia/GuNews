# GuNews
GuNews is a fake-news-free headlines app that is free of clutter and overloaded features.
It was rewritten following the Android Architecture Components guidelines,
which Google has been promoting lately.

And of course: it's powered by theguardian.com,
one of few trustworthy news sources out there
in this time of fake news epidemic.


**Please note**:
 
1. The app shows headlines with news related images. This could eat into your data allowance, especially if you are on limited cellular data. To reduce data usage, go to the *Settings* and switch off *Show images in the news list*.

2. You can refine the search results by adjusting the order by in Settings. Try with relevance, newest or oldest for better results.


## GuNews and GoNews?

**GuNews** focuses on showing *guaranteed fake-free news* and to make that happen, GuNews is sourced from trusted news only, i.e. *theguardian.com*. **GoNews** meanwhile shows *unfiltered news* from various news outlets from many countries. For these kind of news the app relies of the free service, which has limited daily request, provided by *newsapi.org*.

In short: if you want to be safe use GuNews. However if you are proficient enough to spot real news headlines, click-baiting and bombastic headlines and suspected fake-news stories, use GoNews.

I may combine the two in one app in the future.
