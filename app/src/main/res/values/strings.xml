    <string name="about_me">Quite late to late to coding, but I have been always interested in IT.\n\nSo when I hadn\'t started my official Android programming course yet, I was running a project I called the Nias Keyboard Project. Basically coding for Android before learning how to code :)\n\nI have a few apps ideas so I\'m looking forward to learning enough and starting real work!\n\nBTW the recently accomplished Udacity\'s nanodegree program in Android Basics is only the beginning.\n\nPlease don\'t hesitate to giving me feedback. Just reach out by clicking on this floating action bar or by sending feedback in the app Settings.</string>
